# Thesis

### What is the title of your project? 
Visualizing Interactivity in Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG)

### Synopsis
This thesis attempts to explore the activity of players in an MMORPG by visualizing the interactions they engage in while playing the game and reveal patterns behind them. What do they do while playing the game? Who do they meet and who do they talk to? Do they spend more time interacting with humans or the virtual environment? What are their usage patterns like and what motivates them to become so invested in these shared virtual environments? Not much is known about the structure and nature of these interactions. Hence, I plan to investigate these interactions through a visualization to better understand the psychology behind them. The game I will be using in this investigation is [Aion](na.aiononline.com). It was developed by a Korean gaming company called [NCSOFT](http://us.ncsoft.com/en/) and they have servers in Asia, Europe, and North America. I have personally played this game myself so I am familiar with the concept of the game.

### What is its topic / subject matter?
Human Factors, Social Interaction, Shared Virtual Environments

### What are the most important features or aspects of your project? 
A tool that helps visualize and summarize gameplay activity.

### What kind of material you are dealing with?
Chat logs that have been extracted from the game - it contains activity in the game with some level of detail.

### Why have you chosen just this topic?
Because the social nature of games have recently been an important factor for success in these shared virtual environments.

### How do you approach the topic? (In other words, what is your method?)
I plan to investigate these interactions through three different categories:
- The first category is communication. Where, when, and how often to they talk to or socialize with another player or group of players? What kind of public utterances is a player exposed to when walking by two people talking to each other in a city? Who do they meet?
- The second category is character (avatar) interactions and whether or not it interacts with another player character (PC) or a non-player character (NPC). Do player characters duel each other often?
- The third and final category is finance and admin, where is about players how much a player earns and spends in the game. Who do they buy and sell things to? How they use those resources to upgrade their items. This upgrading system is a very interesting game mechanic because it shares parallels with gambling – it is one of the things that keeps people hooked.

### What is the general (cultural, social, political, aesthetic, theoretical...) meaning of your project?
Things people do in shared virtual environments and what keeps them there.

### What kind of a contribution does it give to the field in question?
It allows people to visually investigate gameplay activity over time 

### How is your project related to earlier works on the field (who or what have been your most important influences)?
I have not seen any visualiation tool that does what I am planning to do (at least publically). The closest tools I have seen so far are Aion RainMeter and Advanced Combat Tracker – both of which focus on the combat elements in the game. They do summarize private chats split channel logs, however, they offer no visual representation of them.

### To whom is the project addressed?
People who are interested in finding out what goes on in virtual shared environments as well people who are engaged in this space.

### Who/what does your project represent? How can the data be rigorously generalized to offer meaning beyond the data points you collected?
Human input.

### What are your primary data structures, how did you optimize, and does it sustain into the future?
Time, player name, type of interaction.
